I thought it would be easy to set up Jekyll, but in the end I still encountered a few difficulties.

## Preserving my old Msc project pages
When I studied my Msc at UCL, I used Github Pages to host my [research project](/tag/assessed-project/) on reading activities and the home. Originally I used [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) to host the content and converted the content into static pages and host it on Github. However, I lost the database file for Ghost and could no longer update the blog. I still want to preserve the content as it is while finding a way to keep the site alive.

## Using Jekyll

Recently I found Jekyll. With instructions from [here](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10198964), [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5165), and resolving a few file conflicts, I was able to host it on Github Pages.

## Running Jekyll locally on Windows 10

Setting up Jekyll on a Mac was painless, but it was a different story on Windows. It seems that Ruby (the language Jekyll is written in) and Windows are known to be incompatible. I followed the guide [here](https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/) to install Ruby on Windows 10.

## Changing the theme

The default theme `minima` was frankly, not very pretty. I found the theme [Garth](https://garth.darn.es/), which met my needs. I forked it and resolved a few dependency errors, and it worked perfectly.

## Solving a Unicode issue on Windows

When I switched to my Windows machine at home, I encountered an issue while generating the Jekyll blog locally. After some research, it turned out to be an issue with encoding. Following the instructions here, finally everything worked out.

I'm so happy that this site is alive again. ðŸ˜ƒ
