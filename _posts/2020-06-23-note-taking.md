title: A text renaissance?

I've tried almost all note-taking apps on the market that I could get my hands on. Just this year I have tried Joplin, Standard Notes, Inkdrop, Notion, Numbus Note, Obsidian, and Roam Research. This led to a lot of time spent fiddling with tools rather than getting actual notes taken.

With the rising popularity of Roam Research, interconnectivity between notes has gained attention. I can definitely see how the feature would be useful to me. Rather than biting the bullet and paying for the Roam Research subscription, I explored TiddlyWiki, Obsidian, and a Jekyll theme called [**Simply Jekyll**](https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/) that claims to support bi-directional linking. None of these worked particularly well for me. Why is it so difficult for me to settle on a tool?
