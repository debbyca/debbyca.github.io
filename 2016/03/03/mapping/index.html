            <p>The map of the flat was created as soon as I arrived home after the first visit to C's home. After about 20 minutes, I created the following map.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../content/images/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2015-11-06-at-5-47-57-PM.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The map was created by the app <a href="http://www.iosimple.com/">HouseDesignFree</a>, which was fairly easy to use. The built-in icons allowed me to roughly outline the furniture in the space.</p>

<p>Apps with advanced features, such as <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a>, were available, but it had a steeper learning curve than HouseDesignFree. Since the flat I visited only had two rooms, I decided not to spend too much time on crafting the map and instead focus on other aspects of the research.</p>

<p>During in-class discussions, a common anxiety shared by the students was how to make the map interactive. Specifically, a few classmates struggled to find convenient ways to zoom in and zoom out particular portions of the map. Tools such as <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> and <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/">ThingLink</a> were suggested. </p>

<p>Since there were only two rooms in my fieldsite, a static floor plan should be sufficient to present the look of the home. This particular map was used in a sheet for the participant to record her reading habits, and she agreed that it could represent her living quarters.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="index.html#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
