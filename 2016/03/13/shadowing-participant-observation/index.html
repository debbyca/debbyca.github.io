            <p>I shadowed C's reading activities on a weekday afternoon in November, 2015. Participant observation was carried out for about two and a half hours.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>During the initial interview, C explained to me that her research process contained four or five stages. The stage I had the opportunity to observe was the reading/note-taking stage, highlighted in red in the following diagram.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../content/images/2016/03/screen.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Since she had printed out the journal articles she wanted to read before my shadowing, I observed her reading process of several journal articles. She did not mention using any device while reading journal articles in print, so I did not expect to witness much of her technology use.</p>

<h3 id="findings">Findings</h3>

<p>My observations are summarized as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bodily engagement with journal papers
<ul><li>She highlighted the passages of importance with yellow or orange markers.</li>
<li>She paraphrased some of the authors' ideas in the margins of the papers with a blue pen.</li>
<li>She wrote down her own thoughts in the margins with a pencil.</li>
<li>She used different colors of post-it notes sometimes. When I asked her if she had color-coded different ideas with different colors, her answer was negative. She chose the colors randomly, and even if she had meant something when she used a certain color of post-it, she would have forgotten about the original intention when she returned to it.</li></ul></li>
<li>The mobile phone
<ul><li>While never mentioned in the prior interview, she used her mobile phone very often while studying.</li>
<li>She mostly used the dictionary app to look up unfamiliar words and went back immediately to the reading after reading the results.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usefulnessofthemethod">Usefulness of the Method</h3>

<p>Participant observation was useful in this study. Even though I only observed her in one stage of her reading cycle, I gained insight on her mobile phone use, which was not revealed during the interview. I also witnessed her tactile engagement with the texts at hand.</p>
