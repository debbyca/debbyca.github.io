    <p>I thought it would be easy to set up Jekyll, but in the end I still encountered a few difficulties.</p>

<h2 id="preserving-my-old-msc-project-pages">Preserving my old Msc project pages</h2>
<p>When I studied my Msc at UCL, I used Github Pages to host my <a href="/tag/assessed-project/">research project</a> on reading activities and the home. Originally I used <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> to host the content and converted the content into static pages and host it on Github. However, I lost the database file for Ghost and could no longer update the blog. I still want to preserve the content as it is while finding a way to keep the site alive.</p>

<h2 id="using-jekyll">Using Jekyll</h2>

<p>Recently I found Jekyll. With instructions from <a href="https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10198964">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5165">here</a>, and resolving a few file conflicts, I was able to host it on Github Pages.</p>

<h2 id="running-jekyll-locally-on-windows-10">Running Jekyll locally on Windows 10</h2>

<p>Setting up Jekyll on a Mac was painless, but it was a different story on Windows. It seems that Ruby (the language Jekyll is written in) and Windows are known to be incompatible. I followed the guide <a href="https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/">here</a> to install Ruby on Windows 10.</p>

<h2 id="changing-the-theme">Changing the theme</h2>

<p>The default theme <code class="highlighter-rouge">minima</code> was frankly, not very pretty. I found the theme <a href="https://garth.darn.es/">Garth</a>, which met my needs. I forked it and resolved a few dependency errors, and it worked perfectly.</p>

<h2 id="solving-a-unicode-issue-on-windows">Solving a Unicode issue on Windows</h2>

<p>When I switched to my Windows machine at home, I encountered an issue while generating the Jekyll blog locally. After some research, it turned out to be an issue with encoding. Following the instructions here, finally everything worked out.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m so happy that this site is alive again. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
