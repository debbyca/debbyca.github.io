I finished reading *Persuasion* some time last month. Admittedly I watched the 2007 film version first.

The adaptation had much room for improvement, but the appearances of the main characters agreed with me (how vain I was). I do think that the message of the novel managed to get through.

The novel had many more subtleties. The protagnist, Anne Elliot, is quiet and introspective, not unlike myself, which is mainly why I identify with her so much. Captain Wentworh is attractive to me because he made his own living and was disdainful of the upper class.

The ending happened because of an overheard conversation and a passionate letter. How wonderful to see Anne being rewarded for saying the perfect thing at the right time. I cannot put it better than Trevor's [review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/26732040?book_show_action=true). In light of a conversation I overheard at the workplace today, we women still have the history against us despite that 200 years have passed. Anne deserves her happiness for eventually going against the social norms and the unwelcome influences from her family.
