<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2015-11-06-at-5-47-57-PM.png" alt="Mapping"></p>

<p>The map was created by the app <a href="http://www.iosimple.com/">HouseDesignFree</a>, which was fairly easy to use. The built-in icons allowed me to roughly outline the furniture in the space.</p>

<p>Apps with advanced features, such as <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a>, were available, but it had a steeper learning curve than HouseDesignFree. Since the flat I visited only had two rooms, I decided not to spend too much time on crafting the map and instead focus on other aspects of the research.</p>

<p>During in-class discussions, a common anxiety shared by the students was how to make the map interactive. Specifically, a few classmates struggled to find convenient ways to zoom in and zoom out particular portions of the map. Tools such as <a href="http://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> and <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/">ThingLink</a> were suggested. After evaluating the data I collected, I decided to use an old fashioned technology—GIF animations, to present the findings. Please refer to the post on diaries for the details.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Migratory Paths of Reading Materials]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>When I visited the flat for the first time, C introduced to me how she allocated books in different locations in the flat according to their relevance to her studies.

<p>Since C was a PhD student, she had to do a lot of writing on her laptop. The laptop, therefore, was placed on the table where she did most of her studies. She preferred using the dining table to the desk provided by the landlord because of its position next to the window, from which sounds from the street could be heard<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/03/02/reading-materials/#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/03/IMG_4545_S2.JPG" alt="The Migratory Paths of Reading Materials"></p>

<p>C put the books in different places of the flat according to their relevance to her current study. The books and papers she was reading at the moment were on the dining table. The shelf opposite the table were books of relevance to her. Interesting, those books were all borrowed from the library since she found that books on that shelf gathered dust.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/03/IMG_4540_S.JPG" alt="The Migratory Paths of Reading Materials"></p>

<p>Recent purchases and books of possible relevance were put on the desk or the shelf next to the desk. Originally C put her Kindle on the desk. When I asked her about it, she moved it to the dining table. Still, Kindle was no longer her primary reading device. She purchased hundreds of e-books when she first got hold of the Kindle, but the novelty effects had worn off. The device had become slow, and she felt that the reading experience was not up to par with reading physical books. She would only use Kindle now if one of the e-books stored inside is relevant to her current study.</p>

Since she did not acquire additional furniture when she moved in, the tall and short bookshelves must have been used by the previous occupant of the flat as well. There is ample historical evidence that the library in the house was used as the living room from the 16th to the 19th century.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/03/IMG_4541_S.JPG" alt="Reading in the Personal Library"></p>

<p>According to Wainwright (1991)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the library in the house was never just a room with shelves of books, but curiosities the host had collected from all over the world were also displayed there. Bibliophiles who took pains organizing books, artistic pieces, and various curiosities in the library naturally spent a great deal of time there, so it became the <em>de facto</em> living room (p. 15-16).</p>

<h3 id="thelibraryasaplacewhereguestscongregate">The Library as a Place Where Guests Congregate</h3>

<p>Wainwright (1991)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> explains the increasing importance of the library in a house for social purposes. Country house parties became popular with the construction of the railway, and guests to these parties needed a place to entertain themselves during idle hours under adverse weather conditions.</p>

<p>In my fieldsite, C disclosed in an interview that a friend once came to stay with her for a month in mid-2015. Her friend usually sat in the space between the bedroom and the library-cum-living room. The affordance (Gibson, 1977)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of the step between the bedroom and the living room may have invited the guest to sit there, but it was also possible that she considered the library a more appropriate place to stay in during the day.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/03/IMG_4549_S.JPG" alt="Reading in the Personal Library"></p>

<p>I also stayed in the library-cum-living room when I conducted interviews and ethnography. Apart from books, C adorned the walls with visually striking posters. She explained that the messages from the posters inspired her in her own studies, but their presence in the room captured my attention and elicited reactions from me, as I imagined the curiosities in private libraries in the past would have to the house guests.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/03/IMG_4542_S.JPG" alt="Reading in the Personal Library"></p>

<h3 id="readingasasolitaryactivityoragroupactivity">Reading as a Solitary Activity or a Group Activity</h3>

<p>Historically, the library was also used as the living room for families. Communal reading was a common activity among English families in the 19th century. For instance, in the diaries kept by Emily Shore (1819–1839), she described how her perception of verses and texts were heavily influenced by her father's and cousins' readings and interpretations (Colclough, 2011)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. The image of reading as an activity among family members or groups of people is preserved in the present age. To provide an example, in studies envisioning domestic library systems, family usage is always taken into consideration (Jeyaverasingam &amp; Yang, 2008; Wu, et al., 2009)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Scholarly reading, in contrast, are traditionally seen as a solitary activity. Cook (2011)<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> gives a detailed account of how Victorian scholars consecrated their libraries, where the book collections represented their essential selves. These scholarly libraries operated by exclusion of everyone else so that the scholar could engage in their own intellectual pilgrimage. However, Foucault (1986)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="http://localhost:2368/2016/02/29/a-brief-account-of-the-personal-library/#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> theorized the library as an amalgamation of materials gathered from all places and all times. Not only can the materials be processed in contexts out of their origins but they also resembled the messiness of our everyday living experience. Following this line of thought, people are never truly alone even when they are reading by themselves. With a piece of text in hand, readers are transferred to a different place in time, taking in the messages transmitted by the text.</p>

<p>I will explain in detail how technological devices facilitate this transition among different places in C's reading practices. Here I will only mention how she read in her library and her attempts to create space in which she did not feel alone despite reading by herself.</p>

<h3 id="alonetogether">Alone, Together</h3>

<p>There were large windows in her living room where ambient noises from the street could vaguely be heard. C explicitly said that the noises were comforting to her as they created an atmosphere which was similar to that of a café.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/03/IMG_4545_S.JPG" alt="Reading in the Personal Library"></p>

<p>She expressed her preference of reading in cafés during an interview.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Researcher: There are noises in cafés. Wouldn't you think they are disturbing?</p>
  
  <p>C: I just need some ambient noises. I feel more comfortable with people around me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, she did not think reading together with a friend creates a better reading experience since it hindered her productivity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Researcher: Do you often read by yourself? Or do you find someone else to read with you?</p>
  
  <p>C: I only look for someone when I need help with statistics. Otherwise I don't usually read with others. I tried to find a friend to work together before when there were close deadlines, and I couldn't calm down or concentrate. My friend was a journalist with deadlines. We were both anxious, so we met once or twice.</p>
  
  <p>Researcher: Did you meet in cafés?</p>
  
  <p>C: Yes, but I didn't think it was very helpful. Originally I thought we could get some emotional support from each other, but we ended up chatting during our meetings. I felt so guilty after that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ideal environment for C, then, was somewhere in which she could be alone and also together with other people. She made sure that her library at home bore this spatial feature. Learned people in the past also constructed their library in a way that it juxtaposed the public and private. For instance, in Sir Walter Scott's writing, he noted that the library in his house was right next to the drawing room so that it could accommodate guests when needed (Wainwright, 1991). When he desired a place to study alone, he could close the door between these two rooms for quietude. </p>

<h3 id="theidealstudyingplaceforascholar">The Ideal Studying Place for a Scholar</h3>

<p>Despite her penchant for reading at cafés, C considered her library the ideal place where she could do serious writing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C: I spent more time at home before November since I had a manuscript deadline. </p>
  
  <p>Researcher: Don't you have essay deadlines now?</p>
  
  <p>C: Yes, but there is still plenty of time. The schedule for that manuscript was tight because it had to be done within a month, no actually within three weeks since I had to deliver early. 
  Now... I don't need to deliver writings of a serious nature, so I don't have to stay home all the time where <strong>all the books I need</strong> are beside me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an aspiring scholar, C's vision of the ideal studying place had historical precedence. It needs to allow for both public and private usage, and materials needed should be at disposal.</p>

<p>The area one encountered first when entering the door was the bedroom. There were walls that separated the bedroom and the living room and kitchen. The living room area was transformed into a personal library.</p>

<h3 id="theparticipant">The Participant</h3>

<p>The occupant of the flat was a first-year PhD student in a social science department at a university in London. She was originally from Taiwan and studied her Master's degree in the U.K a few years ago. </p>

<p>C (psyeudonym) identified herself as a bibliophile. As she went back to Taiwan for several years after completing her Master's degree, she had sent her book collection to her parents' home back then. Some of that collection and the materials she acquired during her life in Taiwan traveled with her to London again after she commenced PhD studies, and her current collection in the London flat had since grown with new additions.</p>

<p>The research question for the home ethnography assignment was originally “how digital technologies help us understand the meaning of home”, and I think it would be interesting to focus on the home as a private library/study. With the digitization of books, movies, and music albums, I am curious about how people interact with digital media at home. If these forms of digital media are all “new media” and can be reproduced many times without degradation (Manovich, 2001), then what do people do to make digital media bear their personal touch at home?</p>

<p>The form of digital media I want to focus on in is electronic books or documents on e-readers or in the computer. Apart from my personal interest in reading, I think e-books and documents are fascinating because unlike movies and music, it is easy to leave one’s personal touch in e-books and documents with functions such as annotations and highlights. Some people might not modify the files <em>per se</em>, but they might keep reading notes somewhere else if they are serious readers.</p>

<p>How people build and use their personal libraries at home also fascinates me. According to my initial findings, most discussions on e-books are devoted to their different reading experiences from physical books and the positive and negative implications, the ways physical books can be digitalized (and vice versa), how public libraries maintain their digital collections, and even whether public libraries are still relevant or not. Little has been discussed about how people incorporate digital books in their personal libraries and how physical books (if any) and digital books contribute to the idea of the private library/study.</p>

<p>Apart from the materiality of different reading formats, this blog will also address the following issues.</p>

<ol>
<li>The ways in which digital technologies extended the private library to space outside of the home.  </li>
<li>How memory was mediated by technologies.  </li>
<li>Different methods of ethnographic data collection.  </li>
<li>The choice of the platform to present the ethnographic materials.</li>
</ol>
