  &lt;p&gt;If there is a dominant topic within anthropology it is, and probably should be, the study of relationships. Anthropologists recognize that there are no unmediated, pure relationships. All the ways in which relationships exist, including communication, are cultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All human communications are mediated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They agree with much of the existing literature that technologies changes humanity, but this does not make us better or worse. Humanity is always a project in progress. They propose a theory of attainment, which implies something previously unachievable but will become latent in the condition of being human and soon normalized (Miller and Sinanan, 2014: 12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study does not follow the trajectory of post-human (Fukuyama, 2003) or cyborg (Haraway, 1991) studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm already well into my graduate school, but it seems that I haven't found my studying pace yet. I need to develop a habit of constantly writing down what I'm learning for better reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

I've successfully deployed a project on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm already well into my graduate school, but it seems that I haven't found my studying pace yet. I need to develop a habit of constantly writing down what I'm learning for better reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I think it might be a good idea to start a new blog, which technically puts me in the public eye. The pressure to update this blog might force me to work harder. In short, I voluntarily place myself inside a panopticon under the premise that potential supervision would discipline my behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was creepy. In a brighter note, this is an open notebook of technology studies. Many scholars have willingly share their research ideas and processes with the public via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science"&gt;open notebooks&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone happens to stop by, I hope some of the notes would be deemed helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if not for &lt;a href="https://2015.mozillafestival.org/"&gt;Mozfest 2015&lt;/a&gt;, I wouldn't have a Github account. I love what Mozilla's been doing, and I want to make the web a even better place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome to Ghost</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You're live! Nice.

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your blog URL&amp;gt;/ghost/&lt;/code&gt;. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="gettingstarted"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use &lt;em&gt;shortcuts&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;style&lt;/strong&gt; your content. For example, a list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item number one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item number two
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nested item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A final item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or with numbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to buy some milk  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink the milk  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like &lt;a href="http://ghost.org"&gt;http://ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to &lt;a href="http://ghost.org"&gt;the Ghost website&lt;/a&gt;. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="whataboutimages"&gt;What about Images?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="quoting"&gt;Quoting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ghost - Just a blogging platform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="workingwithcode"&gt;Working with Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id="readyforabreak"&gt;Ready for a Break?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id="advancedusage"&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
